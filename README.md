# SECURDE Milestone Project 2
**ATO, PAOLO | GAMUTAN, MART | LOPEZ, LUIS**

This is a **NetBeans** project. You are encouraged to use NetBeans when working on this project, as NetBeans recognizes the GUI elements placed using its GUI builder.

**Note:** To decrease slug size, SQLite executables (`sqlite\*.exe`) and the SQLite JDBC driver (`sqlite-jdbc\*.jar`) have been included in the `.gitignore` file. **Please download these separately and place them in the main directory.**
